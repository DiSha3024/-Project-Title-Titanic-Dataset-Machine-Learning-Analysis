roject Title: Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Analysis

Description: Implemented a machine learning (ML) project using the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes of passengers. Utilized various ML algorithms to build predictive models and evaluated their performance.

Key Contributions:

Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Explored data insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.
Trained multiple ML models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
Tuned model hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation to optimize performance.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployed the best performing model to predict survival outcomes for unseen data.
Skills Demonstrated:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Exploratory data analysis for insights discovery.
Machine learning model selection, training, and evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Deployment of ML models for prediction tasks.
This project showcases my proficiency in machine learning techniques and ability to derive meaningful insights from datasets, demonstrating skills essential for a data analyst or data scientist role.
